# Build an Interactive Form

This is the 3rd project for the team treehouse techdegree as a javascript full stack developer.

See [requirements](Documentation/requirements.md) for the instructions.

You might also be interested in my [notes](Documentation/notes.md) where I share my thoughts about why I chose one way of solution over another. 

I've used github-Pages to make the result clickable for you. 
Click [here](https://stho32.github.io/treehouse-Build-an-Interactive-Form/Source/index.html) to go to the result page.

In a nutshell, this project is about a form that is extended by unobtrusive javascript
to provide client side validation and a little interaction. 

With deactivated Javascript the form shall still be able to provide all the functionality, 
well at least it should be usable.
