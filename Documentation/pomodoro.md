# Pomodoro log

Each point is a pomodoro of work.

  1. Created project on github, wrote down requirements and created basic folder structure. And of course this pomodoro log.
  1. Added the files that have been provided by team treehouse. Solved (R1). Checked (R1). Updated the repository at github to use github pages. Updated readme.md to reference the index.html to be more convenient for reviewers.
  1. Added jquery + main.js. Started working on (R2).
