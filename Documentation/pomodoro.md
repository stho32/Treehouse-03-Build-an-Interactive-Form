# Pomodoro log

Each point is a pomodoro of work.

  1. Created project on github, wrote down requirements and created basic folder structure. And of course this pomodoro log.
  1. Added the files that have been provided by team treehouse. Solved (R1). Checked (R1). Updated the repository at github to use github pages. Updated readme.md to reference the index.html to be more convenient for reviewers.
  1. Added jquery + main.js. Started working on (R2).
  1. Finished (R2), started working on (R3). 
  1. Taking up the work from yesterday. Reviewing requirements video to get additional information about the interaction that treehouse would like to have. E.g. what needs to be in the html and what is dynamically added via javascript.
  1. Updated and simplified R2. Reread and reviewed R3. Started to rework R3.
  1. Finished work on R3 and found out that this way I already finished R4, too. Started to work on R5.
  1. Working on R5.
  1. R5 is working now but we still need some graphical glue.
